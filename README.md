<h2>Memberpress German Translation using DeepL</h2>

The Translation is done entirely by DeepL v2 Free, without any manual correction.<br>
This German Translation is a base project, feel free to commit changes.<br><br>
Altough Memberpress has an official german translation, this will also work in combination with Buddyboss and Buddypress (which normally overrides the translation)<br><br>

<h3>How to use the language file?</h3>
The files (.po & .mo) are used by the Plugin Loco Translate (https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).<br>
If you want to know how to import the language files, please refer to the Loco Translate Guide: https://localise.biz/help/formats/importing <br>
I hope it helps you as much as it helped me.<br>
<b>Stay fresh guys.</b>
